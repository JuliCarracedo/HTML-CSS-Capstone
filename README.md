## Project Description
This website is an online web store for computer parts, based on [this design](https://www.behance.net/gallery/24796463/ZATTIX) by Mohammed Awad (link to his profile on Author section)

There are two pages implemented:
- Home page: Consisting of a set of categories to buy from and a main carousel with interesting products
- Search Results Page: With (not working) Filters to make a search more specific and an arbitrary set of search results for the word "Intel"
Both pages share a header with links to both pages, a footer with acces to the home screen, and a space to enter a keyword to search for.
